[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>> CohenEffectSize(firsts.totalwgt_lb,others.totalwgt_lb)

After running Cohen's Effect Size function, the difference between means of first born babies and others is -.089 standard deviations, which is small. We can conclude that first born babies are generally lighter, but not significant enough to have a profound effect on smaller samples.
